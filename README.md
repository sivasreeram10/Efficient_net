EfficientNet-Based Banana Plant Disease Detection
Overview
This project implements EfficientNetB0, a highly optimized and scalable deep learning model, for detecting banana plant diseases using leaf images. EfficientNet provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Features
âœ… Highly Accurate â€“ EfficientNet provides state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.
âœ… Optimized for Mobile & Edge Devices â€“ Can be deployed on IoT-based disease monitoring systems.
âœ… Transfer Learning â€“ Uses a pretrained ImageNet model to extract disease features.
âœ… Real-Time Detection â€“ Processes images efficiently with minimal computational overhead.

Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing healthy and diseased banana leaf images. Categories include:

Healthy Leaves
Diseased Leaves (e.g., Fusarium Wilt, Black Sigatoka, Banana Bunchy Top Virus, etc.)
Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Load high-resolution banana leaf images.
Resize images to 224Ã—224 pixels (EfficientNetB0 input size).
Apply image augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) for better generalization.
2. Model Architecture (EfficientNetB0)
EfficientNet enhances feature extraction by using:

Compound Scaling â€“ Balances depth, width, and resolution for better accuracy.
Inverted Bottleneck Layers â€“ Improve efficiency while retaining features.
Swish Activation â€“ Enhances non-linearity and improves performance.
Batch Normalization â€“ Stabilizes and accelerates training.
3. Training the Model
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy & Loss
4. Classification & Prediction
The trained model classifies banana leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.
Provides confidence scores for predictions.
Can be deployed on mobile apps, web platforms, and IoT-based monitoring systems.
